1. Tell me about yourself.
   My name is Yan Chen. I've been with the firm for almost 7 years, I started my carrear as a teller for little over a year and Personal banker for another year, then 3 and a half years as a Relationship Banker, all these three years I've made it all to the National Achievers trip. Outside of Chase, I love to travel, I've just been to Singapore/ Thailand last December and I'm heading to Paris this Saturday.

2. Why do you want to be a Private Client Banker?
   With all these years with Chase, my goal was always trying to become a Chase Private Client Banker. And throughout the years, I've seen a lot of successful bankers and partners, one of my key mentor and partner is Kelvin Tsai, and I wanna take the same path as him. In addtion to that, as a private client banker, I would be the one to deepen the relationship with clients and work with partners to provide a one-stop finacial solution to the clients.

3. What's the difference between relationship banker and private client banker?
   As a relationship banker, we're the one who discover the client's needs and send referrals, while chase private client bankers are the ones build the trust and deepening the relationship with the clients and be the bridge between One Chase team and the clients. As a private client banker, they focus more on the quality of the service and advice they provide.

4. If you become an PCB, how do you plan on supporting RBs?
   I think communication is the key, I will always follow up with the current status of the referrals, keep them in the loop. I will write details notes on the client central to remind myself and the bankers. build the trust and have a good relationship with the bankers and support the bankers. Be their mentor, and spend time with them to do joint calls.

5. Walk me through your days
   First thing I do in the morining is to open up my client central and review my plan of the day, my main focus during the call block are portfolio leads and follow ups. I will also check to see how many appointments I have and plan the my day. By the end of the day, I do some joint calls with the partners.
